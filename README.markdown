# DDR2 Memory Transaction Processing Logic (Verilog)

## Overview

This Verilog module implements the core logic for managing read and write transactions to DDR2 SDRAM memory. 
It forms a key part of a DDR2 memory controller by handling command sequencing, address management, data flow, 
and refresh cycles to ensure correct DDR2 memory operation.

## Features

- Implements a state machine that sequences all DDR2 commands needed for reading, writing, and refreshing memory.
- Manages addressing with separate row, column, and bank address registers.
- Supports burst read and write operations with configurable burst length and CAS latencies.
- Generates key DDR2 control signals such as chip select (CS), row address strobe (RAS), column address strobe (CAS), and write enable (WE).
- Handles refresh timing autonomously to maintain memory integrity.
- Interfaces with command and data FIFOs to buffer and manage command and data flow.
- Controls data mask (DM) signals and data strobes (DQS) for DDR2 write operations.

## Module Interface

### Inputs

- clk : System clock.
- reset : Active-high synchronous reset.
- ready_init_i : Signal indicating DDR2 initialization is complete.
- CK : Slower memory clock signal.
- addr_cmdFIFO_i : Command FIFO address input.
- cmd_cmdFIFO_i : Command FIFO command input.
- sz_cmdFIFO_i : Command FIFO size input (burst size).
- op_cmdFIFO_i : Command FIFO operation input.
- din_dataFIFO_i : Data FIFO input for write data.
- emptyBar_cmdFIFO_i : Signal indicating command FIFO is not empty.
- fullBar_returnFIFO_i : Signal indicating return FIFO is full.
- fillcount_returnFIFO_i : Fill level of return FIFO buffer.

### Outputs

- addr_returnFIFO_o : Address output for return FIFO.
- get_cmdFIFO_o : Signal to read from command FIFO.
- get_dataFIFO_o : Signal to read from data FIFO.
- put_returnFIFO_o : Signal to write to return FIFO.
- csbar_o, rasbar_o, casbar_o, webar_o : DDR2 chip select and command strobes.
- readPtr_ringBuff_o : Read pointer output for ring buffer.
- listen_ringBuff_o : Signal to enable ring buffer data listening.
- dq_SSTL_o : Data output to DDR2 memory interface.
- dm_SSTL_o : Data mask output for DDR2 writes.
- dqs_i_SSTL_o : Data strobe output for DDR2 writes.
- ba : Bank address output.
- a : Address output.
- ts_i_o : Data strobe enable signal.
- ri_i_o : Read enable signal.

## How It Works

This module works by reading commands from a FIFO buffer and executing them step by step following DDR2 timing requirements. 
It controls the DDR2 address, bank, and command strobes, managing memory activation, reads, writes, and auto-refresh cycles internally.
The module includes logic to handle burst operations where multiple data words are transferred in sequence, and it generates 
data strobes (DQS) and data mask signals (DM) during write operations to synchronize data transfer.
A refresh counter ensures memory is refreshed periodically to prevent data loss.

## Integration Notes

- This module is intended to be part of a larger DDR2 memory controller system.
- It depends on external FIFO modules for buffering commands and data.
- The ready_init_i signal should only be asserted after DDR2 initialization is complete.
- The CK input is a clock running at memory speed, usually half the system clock.
- Proper timing and synchronization should be maintained when integrating with other modules.
